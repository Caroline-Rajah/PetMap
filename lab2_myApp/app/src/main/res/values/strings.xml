        "Tinker is a Rat Terrier or Toy Fox Terrier Mix, female. She was born approximately in January 2006."
        "She weighs 8 lbs. She is crate trained.\n\n"
        "She’s very affectionate and outgoing, except when it comes to being picked up or walking on a leash.\n"
        "Currently any situation that calls for her to do either is extremely stressful for her, so training classes will be required for Tinker in her new home."
        "Compatibility with other dogs depends mostly on their size. Cat compatibility is still being evaluated.\n\n\n"
        "Their Adoption Process\n"
        "Additional Adoption Info\n\n"
        "First, decide on the kind of dog or cat you want (large, small, active, older, puppy, kitten, long hair, short hair, etc.) and find a few pets that fit your criteria on our web site.\n"

        "Then either contact the foster home directly or visit us at our weekly pet fairs.\n"

        "Next a NARF representative will conduct an interview to make sure that the pet of your choice is a good match.\n"

        "The donation for dogs ranges from $200 – $300, and $120 for cats. This donation covers the cost of spaying or neutering, vaccinations, and microchipping. In some cases, a training contract may be required for our dogs with an additional deposit.\n\n"
